nothing that i have
nothing that i love
nothing that i should be grateful for
can take away the ache

because the ache is real

it feels like loss
it feels like fear
it feels like
i'm broken

broken down
down to meaningless
rubble

a fraction of the man i was
if i was
even a man at all

I had their trust 
and in just a moment 
it was all gone

i couldn't see it coming
i thought there was still so much time
but there was no time
and we fell
all too soon
we lost

i know that it shouldn't matter
i know the thing we lost wasn't all that important
but what i really lost
was trust

i feel hopeless 

hope is all i ever was
hope is all i've ever been
and now it's gone 
and so am i

am i?

not really
right?

so under the shielding protection
of my big dreams
and my big hope
i must have existed

there must have been something under all of that hope

i must have been under all that
so i must still be here
but where am i

i can't find me

where am i?

dramatic
right?

but it's real
that's how i really feel

so
my fear is that i've lost everything
and it may be true that i have lost
some
things

but i'm willing to fight like hell to get them back

and the only way to truly lose everything
is to walk away

and i won't

i won't walk away

I can't because the hope 
that i said was my shield
i didn't just pick that up from somewhere
i made it

because i'm made of it

i'm made of hope
and somehow
despite everything
i still believe

i still believe that we can be united

i believe that we can win the greatest battle
which is to fall
but then to stand
to stand together
and fight with all the heart that we have 
all the heart that we can have together

i believe that we can
and i won't walk away
because i need to try
i have to because that's who i am
hope

so
will you forgive?
and will you try to understand each other?
and will you put your heart
into coming away from our past?
and into our future?
whatever future that may be
despite the wins and losses we may see?
