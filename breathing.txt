i don't know i just wish i wasn't breathing

the air beside my face
too thick
far too heavy

my lungs pump with all their strength
but i'm far too distracted by
the four thousand forty first video that has flipped itself in front of me

nothing can quite my brain
what to do?
i don't know i just wish i wasn't breathing
