what do you want to know?

i'm just one person
but i'm more than just one thing
i'm so many parts | voices | intentions | wants and desires
my consciousness holds only one real voice
but so many parts can use that voice to explain
what they want or what they think
or they just shout a random phrase 
that they just want to say
it's loud in here

and there are even more voices that don't have access to this voice
they speak but without words
they hold quiet so often
but they really have so much to say
they emote | cry | and do charades
to show me what they think
what they want

i can't be responsible for all this
it's too much and i want to go to sleep

i can't hold them all inside me
i can't hear them all or give them what they need
i can't be what they want me to be
they have so much that was given to them by people who never cared
and it's my job to help them let go of what they were given
but i can't do it
i just want to sleep
