i don't think you're dumb
but you're not where i thought you were
not where i though you would be

when i finally arrived here
you weren't there waiting for me

we talk as if we're in the same place
but you not actually here
something is missing

i don't need you to be here
i just thought you would be

are you on your way?
will you b here soon?

do i need to tell you to wait
to wait until you get here
before you decide to be with someone forever
because if you pick her now
and then you get here later
you'll see how far she has to go

she could come with
she could meet you here later
but i'm pretty sure that you'll get here eventully
and i don't think it's wise to bank everything
on the assumption that she'll follow along
or that she'll get here eventually too

maybe she will
maybe she won't

this concerns me
but i can't talk to you about it because you don't understand where i am
