what's the truth

is i
a thing to be seen

is the truth
a thing to be said

is it
a thing to be known
or maybe a thing that
we think we can know

is the truth
a measurement
of the precise location of things in space
charted over the course of time

is it
a thing we can hold
even in some sense
in ourselves

surely it cannot be owned
surely it is it's own

is it?
