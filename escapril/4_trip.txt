i can't write without music
i can't work
and i definitely can't clean my house
without music
usually
or else my brain will trip
on one or more
of the many
distractions that
are vying for my attention

today though
my brain trips
over the music that's meant to focus me

tripping is what my brain has always been best at
finding any and every reason
to not do
the things i'm supposed to do

and then i get mad at myself
for tripping

the worst is when
i really have nothing
that i'm supposed to do
so the detour trips aren't bad
and i enjoy them
but then
for some reason
i'm still mad at myself for tripping

but it's hard not to trip
when that's actually what i want to do

is writing this what i'm supposed to be doing?
or is this a trip too?
