i recently saw a photo
from my childhood
that i've seen a million times

but lately
i've been realizing
that i don't have a lot of memories
from my childhood
so when i saw
this photo of my cousin and i
as two-year-old kids
i tried to remember

not from the third-person perspective
of looking at the photo
but the first-person perspective
that i might have had back then

and i remembered things

but the memories were
different than i expected

they weren't just pictures
or words ringing in my head

they were mostly emotions

i've never had good words for emotions
but i'd like to try

because you meant something to me
that i couldn't have known then
and i had since forgotten

it felt like peace
like there was no reason to be scared
and everything was ok

it was like this feeling that
there was this real person
who was
just like me in so many ways

and that made me feel real too

it felt like joy and excitement
it felt like adventure
and finding buried treasure

and i remember
holding on so tightly
to every word you said
like i wanted to keep them forever

you were my first best friend

and i don't really know when we grew apart
but i realize now
that ever since that time
when we were kids
that those were the feelings and emotions
that i've always searched for
in other friends
and i've always held onto
the friends that felt just like
my first best friend
