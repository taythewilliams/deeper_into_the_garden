i've changed my state

i'm not what i used to be

you
are exactly
what you've always been

i've learned and grown
and built and sewn

i've watched and studied
and cried and muddied
the waters
of the truth of our fathers

all while you
have just sat

and stared
at the wall
and cared
not at all
impared
by protocol

because you're too scared to be
what you are
and you're too scared to see
who you are

down deep
but not all that deep
because the wall that keeps
your pains and beats
you up and treats
you badly and loathes your repugnance well
it's not that far down

change your state
of being
and your rate
of seeing

stop lying
please stop vying
for fake trying
and all your buying
just to keep hiding

change your state

i mean you can move to a new one
that wouldn't hurt

but please change your hate
that you keep calling love
and stop being fake
and cut out this bluff

to start
all you have to do is listen
and trust
and don't be defenseive
and just try
please just try
