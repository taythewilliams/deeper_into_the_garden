the internet says
that pigs eat pies
and the market will rise

the internet says
that goats eat all
and the markets will fall

the internet says
that i have cancer

the internet says
that i'll be healed
in three months

i read on the internet
that mondays have the most suicides
the ocean is really deap
and diet coke was invented in 1982
but it doesn't know
weather that's older than you
and i don't know
if any of that is true

the internet says 
that avocados are a fruit
and so are tomatoes

australia is wider than the moon
and a shrimp's heart is in its head

i'm not really concerned about shrimp heads
but i am concerned about yours

yours is stuck in the internet

i can see that you can't get it out

when you look out into the trees
or watch the clouds
you can wonder at the beauty
but not without taking pictures of it
and it only takes about three minutes
before you start to feel an itch

and then you run to the internet
away from your itch

it's an itch that comes from inside you
they are called emotions

all they need is for you to listen to them
but you think 
you're supposed to fix them
the way you think 
you're supposed to fix 
everything that little children say to you

you think you're supposed to fix those emotions you have
the way you thought that i was asking for advice
when i said 
that i was sad
or when i said 
that i was hurt

i didn't need you to fix me
i just needed you to listen
i just wanted to be heard

and so do your emotions

but the internet says
that the real name for a hashtag is an octothorpe
and someone you know had a baby
and appearantly you want me to know that too
but i don't want to know that

what i want 
is for you to figure out how to fucking listen

and i don't even need you to listen to me anymore
i can do that for myself

but i don't want to talk to you about the internet
so you better figure out how to listen to yourself
becasue if you ever expect to have a relationship
with me
then you've gotta figure out
how to be a little deeper
than an internet robot
that vomits facts
and is programmed to fix fix fix
even though you know nothing
except what you think you've learned
from
the internet
