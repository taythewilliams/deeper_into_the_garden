tomorrow

i'm always afraid of tomorrow

probably because i've experienced too many todays
where i wasn't prepared
and i felt the humiliation
and the frustration
of forgetting

i've forgotten a lot of things

not that they have been erased from my memory banks
but i didn't remember them
when i was supposed to

so now i'm weary
of what tomorrow might require

i'm afraid that it might tell me
that i've forgotten again

i'm afraid that tomorrow 
will come to me and say
surprise!
i'm nothing that you could have predicted
and i'm everything that you don't understand

i'm afraid that my idea of tomorrow
will turn out to be a lie

i'm afraid that tomorrow will bring me something scary

i'm not afraid that it will bring me something hard
i'm not afraid of hard
but i am afraid of knowing and forgetting
the thing that i was supposed to do
the one thing that i was supposed to remember

i try to let tomorrow be whatever it is
and i try not to worry

but i often still do

becuase what if tomorrow...
