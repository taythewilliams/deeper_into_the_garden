she calls it a spiral

when she spins around and around
looking at all of the possibilities
pointing at the options
and her brain spouts out the pros and cons
while some part of her is scared
but she doesn't feel anything
she just weighs the possible pains
and can't make a decision
because there is no clear winner

i call it
intellectualizing
the emotions that want her
to feel

she could feel

if that had been allowed

if every attempt at feeling
that she had ever seen anyone else do
hadn't resulted in such a betrayal

she could do the feeling that she needs

if that had ever been allowed

if that hadn't been considered
to be such a selfish weakness

and so she spirals

because what else is there to do
when the feels can't be felt
because that's not allowed
and so the only one left around who can do anything at all
is the brain
who can spiral
who can think
who considers options
and weighs and judges outcomes

and so she spirals
