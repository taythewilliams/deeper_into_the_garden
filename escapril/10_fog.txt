i think i see a person
but they are just a figure in the fog

i blink my eyes and nothing is clearer

i'm spinning

where
why am i so confused

it's like fog
but the truth is
i'm just so tired of being sad
that my brain doesn't know anything

i'd like to choose how to move forward
but it's been chosen for me

i'll cry myself to sleep
and then i'll try to run
until the fog
has found me again
and all i remeber is how the fog feels
and it will be chosen for me again

cry
sleep
run
fog
