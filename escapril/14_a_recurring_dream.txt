the last eight days of my life
have been a recurring dream

the days were all different

but when i call it quits
and i walk to my bed
the way my blanket fits
and the way my pillow holds my head

all i feel is the way i felt
eight days ago
when my friend died
and i cried and cried

there's also so much guilt
like who am i
to waste so much time 
so much time spent feeling
instead of the million other things
that require
my attention and my time

every day
i get out of bed
before my alarm makes a sound
and i live the day
and i do the things
and i go where i'm needed

but then i return
to the same bed
in the same shape

to the same damn sight
in the same dim light

all i feel is the way i felt
eight days ago when my friend died
and i cried and cried

but there are no tears left now
and i have nothing left to say
all i have to do is live through
the same dream every night

i don't actually dream when i sleep
but i go to bed
and suddenly i'm awake
i check the time and my alarm will go off soon
so i get up
the day goes by
and i don't care

and suddenly i'm headed back
willing subjecting myself
to my recurring dream

wakeup
lay down
feel the pain and the shame and the rage
wake up
lay down
fall directly into the next day
with no rest
no change
just more of the same
