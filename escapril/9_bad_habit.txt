no
a bad habit is biting your nails

no
i don't think you understand
a bad habit is when
it's late at night
again
and you eat junk food before bed
again

no
you're definitely not getting it
a bad habit
is when you're waiting in line
and you pick up your phone
again
and you start to scroll and scroll
again

no
you don't have
a bad habit

you're just mean
