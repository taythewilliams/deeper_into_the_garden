a portrait of you
deserves steadier hands

but you have no requirements
so
i start to mix paints

i prepare the canvas
with colors that remind me
of emotions

emotions that
collide in me
when i think of you

i've used all of my colors
and you deserve more

but you don't ask for it to be perfect
so i make do with the paint that i have

a portrait of you
deserves a painter
who can understand more than i do

but you pick me
still

so i paint
and i paint
and it's been ten years now
and i still don't know when i'll be done painting
because this portrait of you
has turned into a portrait
of everything beautiful to me
and everything that i didn't even know
was beautiful
until i looked
and there it was
in you

a portrait of you
deserves to be seen
by everyone who is important
and by everyone who can appreciate real beauty

but you are you 
and you don't ask to be seen
and you pick me
to see you

and you let me paint a portrait
even though you don't need one

because i need to
because i don't know how else to behave
when i'm touched by something
so powerful
and unstoppable
and real
and magnificent

a portrait of you
deserves to be completed
and hung in the luve

but you didn't ask for a portrait
and you let me keep painting
and painting forever
because you love me
and I'll keep painting forever
because i have to
