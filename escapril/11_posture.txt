the posture of my soul
is like a doormat today

i really wouldn't mind
if you would just wipe your feet

i really couldn't move from this
face-flat-in-the-porch position
even if i had the will
because i'm a doormat

that's how i feel today

tomorrow
i'll probably have the posture
of a discarded steak

but maybe someday after that
i'll have the posture
of a something more alive
