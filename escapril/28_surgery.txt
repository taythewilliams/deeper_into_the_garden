you don't need two kidneys
you know?

apparently one is enough,

but bodies are complicated
and some people don't have any kidneys that work properly.

and sometimes those people need to be gifted
a kidney from someone who has two good ones.

but who could you ask
to give you their kidney?

who do you know
that would cut open their side
and give you a piece of them
so that you can live?

who do you know?

surgery is scary.
