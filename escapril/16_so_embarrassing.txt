the sight of myself in the mirror

when i interrupt someone
but i didn't mean to do it
and i don't know how to fix it

when i write something
and parts of me come out
that no one else really knows about

when i write anything

my laugh

my body

the way my hair is so thin

the way my face doesn't express anything
and my voice sounds like a robot
because i'm afraid

when i text someone a question
and they respond
but i'm only capable of starting not finishing
so i leave them on read
for longer than i'm willing to say

my feet

my emotions
that i'm barely aquainted with

my greasy nose
