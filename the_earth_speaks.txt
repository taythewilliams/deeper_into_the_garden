what if the earth could speak to us
what would the mountains say?

what would the rivers say
as they run strong to the ocean?

what would the ocean say
as its tide rises
tugged by the moon?

what do the trees say?

what if the earth does speak
but we are too slow to hear it?

what if she does speak
but we are too quickly shuffling to hear it?

if the earth could speak
would she tell us something wise
or is she too wise to speak at all?
