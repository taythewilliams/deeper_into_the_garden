how do i write this?

how do i go to bed
planning
to wake up and wait for the next one
just do do the same thing again

how do i just lay down
every time you ask

how do i live
knowing
that soon
at any moment
you'll do it again

and never say your sorry

the problem isn't what you do
you're human like me

the problem is that
even though we made the same mistakes
i'm the one that says i'm sorry

and you hold forgiveness
like a carrot for me
and i chase it as long as i need to
as long as you need me to

but in the end i'm left with no energy left
to do the same to you 
and you have no carrot for me to use

you don't care about anything that i could use
and you don't care about how it makes me feel

you are the weather
and you do as you please

i am a small tree
you are everything to me
but you don't need me
i am nothing to you
