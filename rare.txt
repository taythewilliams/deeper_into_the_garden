rare things get immitated
everyone has
fake diamonds
fake gold
a lot of people have reals ones too
but the fake ones are more common

rare things are not appreiciated
because they're rare
they get bioled down to their value
people only care about their value

i don't understand this
to me
all things are rare
even a dull stone
on the ground in front of your shoe
it's the only one like it
it's the only one in your hand

pine trees are not rare
but any single pine tree is different than the rest

i'm a human
we're not rare
but i am
