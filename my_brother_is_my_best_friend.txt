My brother is my best friend
he was the first person to love in the way i thought parents loved a child;
unconditionally, without caution, fully, and growingly.
my brother was the first person who didn’t laugh at me
rather he encouraged the things i was so enthralled with that 
people laughed at me for.
my brother became the only person i that i trust without hesitation 
and he teaches me how to love my friends
and he teaches me how i can really love myself.
i wondered for a few years why he would care what happens in my life
and whether or not i am happy 
because he cares with such ease and genuine disconfinement.
oh and to be here today to know he loves me perfectly just because.
my brother taught me that being loved is without reward and 
not a game of tug-of-war.
oh and to be so happy and finally running to a chasm which true freedom fills 
and rushes and leaps
the kind of freedom that only comes when I’m finally the one receiving my own love.
and he taught me that, he continues to show me and tell me
because
my brother is my best friend
and he is the person who fought for the ability to love himself 
So now he can show me and everyone else who stumbles in fear,
the others who keep missing the target when arguing what is most important.
I haven’t seen all the happiness and pain he has seen to be 
the person who loves themself
but i will someday
and he wouldn’t mind if the world, if the acknowledgment never veered towards him,
because he loves himself and knows what to be true.
he swims and glides in the chasm of freedom
and you won't see him until you’re about to jump off 
the precipice, until you’ve accepted who you are and love yourself 
vigorously.
But I’m about to jump.
my feet are lifting, my heart is expanding larger than ever before,
tear ducts overfill with a motion of thanks
to my brother.
because he is my best friend
and now i see what he’s been telling me all along.
