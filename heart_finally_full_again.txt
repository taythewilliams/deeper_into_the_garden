what a cruel experiment 

that the collective consciousness of the universe 
would split off its parts
and ask them to stand alone for a time

oh how i yearn to lift away
from the force of the ground on my feet

to dissolve
back into the other-dimensional 
mist that birthed me

when someday i do

i think i'll ask to stay
for awhile
ask to be held there

known 

and in her state of witnessing 
i would rest with my eyes open
and heart finally full again
