by the grace
of someone above
i saw the willow
that lies in the middle
the middle of the greatest garden

wise
too wise to speak to me
too wise not to see

much older than her age

and under her branches
a rope swing worn smooth by
pilgrims in millenia past

her canopy a sacred place
that fills itself with me

she doesn't show me my way
she shows me myself
and i know
the way

wise
too wise to speak to me
too wise not to see

she doesn't show me the way
she shows me myself
all of me
even the dark
but i'm not afraid now
it's all in the light now

pendant leaves
they smell like peace
they move me to see
me

wise
too wise to speak
too wise not to see

i'd like to be
for you
what she was for me

but if not
you'll just have to go
be with the willow
that's too wise to speak
and too wise not to see
