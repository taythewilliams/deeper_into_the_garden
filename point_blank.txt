point blank
i hate being in your presence

your words
they make my spine shrink
they make my eyes squint
they make my core and my diaphram 
slowly squeeze
all the air from my lungs

and i don't want that air back

i either want to never breath air back in
again
or at least never inhale in your presence
again

point blank
i'd rather never breath
again
than see you
again
than hear your 
arrogant
ignorant
blasphemous
words
again

your shit-stirring
waste-of-space
words

point blank
good bye
forever


whomp whomp
