where are you?

i just want to talk

you don't have to be afraid of me

i don't want you gone
i just want to understand you

you hold something that isn't yours to hold
you see?

and it is MY job
to take care of YOU
you see?
and you shouldn't have to hold that thing for me

i love you
and i'm glad your here
and i know that you are doing your best
for me

anger protects you
he is prepared to yell
and bark back
when they try to hurt you again

i'm so glad that you have this to protect you

but i'm here now
i would like to protect you

would you let me?
