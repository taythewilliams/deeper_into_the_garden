am i stuck
here in this 
cage
that's shaped just like me?

or is it my priviledge
to be here

fuck priviledge

so which is it

a self-portrait prison
or the only place i'd want to be

i chose this
i think

but right now
i'm here and i'm not sure how to breathe

i'm left with no choice
but to feel

if i am only but to feel
then i guess i'll feel

then i guess there's no point in running

i'm so sorry for running
for all the times i tried to run
for abandoning you when you needed me the most
when all you needed was for me to feel
so that you could feel
heard
so that you could feel 
seen
the way you always wanted to be seen
by the ones that you thought should love you

i was there all along

i'm sorry that i ran

i'm sorry that i didn't love you either

thank you for teaching me how

i am 
here now.
