TOD: uncertain

death itself: quite certain

this horizon
when in view
serves as the greatest
maker of value
to life itself

acutely sensitive
to the fleeting nature
of what it means to be alive

to feel
to laugh
or cry

wandering with eyes avoidant

of said horizon
allows one to forget
one's own DEADline

and so the horrors of the world
become a reason to stop living
and to hide instead

so
it is death
i believe
that affords the insight:

this world
--with it's rainbows
delirium
elation
and snakes--
is worth living in
and laughing in
and crying in
and loving

it will all be over too soon
but there is still time
time to cry
time to process
time to laugh
time to feel
time of death: uncertain
death itself: quite certain
