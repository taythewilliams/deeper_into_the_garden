We 
are not the same

we do not smell the same scents
we do not feel the same sensations
we do not see the same colors

i
don't know what you've seen

you
cannot grasp the depth of my compulsion
my view
my healing
my want
my resonation

so do not pretend
do not speak for me

i cannot be spoken for
nor can i be insulted
by you
who doesn't understand
who only sees 
the colors
of the trending 
and viral

you seek the sights
that have been most seen
i seek the sights
that speak
to me
to my deep 
to my longing
