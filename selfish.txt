i used to think that you were being selfish
when you wouldn't do what i asked
Or what i thought i needed from you
because you needed to put yourself first

i used to think it was selfish to do anything at all for yourself
and so
i did nothing for me
and everything i could for you
and for anyone but me

and envied you
as i watched you take care of yourself
the way i wished someone would come take care of me

i used to think it was selfish
to love yourself

but now i see
that's not true

selfish is when
i saw how beautiful you are
and i dropped everything in my life
and i put you on a pedestal 
and worshiped you

because i thought that being with you 
would fix me
would fill me with whatever i had been missing my whole life

selfish is when i found out that
that wasn't true
but i kept you on a pedestal
and kept worshipping you even though it hurt
because i thought that you would fix me

you said all the words
in trying to help me
that i would later come to you and say
in sharing my epiphanies 
but those words weren't the lesson that i needed
it was the hell that i needed
the one that i couldn't avoid
because that's where you were leading me
and i was too afraid to let go of your hand

it was that hell that i needed
because the only way i was ever going to save myself
and love myself 
is if i knew
for a fact
that no one else
was ever going to do it for me

ignorance and immaturity is needing someone else
to teach you a lesson with their words
and then needing them
to pull you through the hell to learn it for yourself

selfish is asking them to do it for you

learning that lesson
doing the work
healing
those things are not selfish
