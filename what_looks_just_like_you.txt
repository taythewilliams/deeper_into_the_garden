dear dad,

you hated your fat,
you hated your thinning hair,
you hated your body,

so like a gift
you handed this to me.
you taught me how to hate

what looks just like you,
then i grew up and guess

what looks just like you.

i was just a kid;
i didn't know better,

and now inside me, i hear someone crying.
he's just a kid
and he doesn't deserve this,
but he hates what i've become
because he lives in the world you made for him;

so i've been teaching him what beauty is:
that it has more to do with love
than the shape that bodies assume,
that i am the only beholder to matter,
and anyone tending to society's design conclusion
couldn't possibly warrant our concern.

when someone's presence
creates a space full of compassion,
connectedness, and curiosity;
confidence, courage, and clarity,
then that person
is a beautiful person.

so i hope you look in the mirror, dad.
and if you see something ugly
i hope you know you're right.
but the ugly thing is your hatred
not you.

we are far apart right now,
but i want you to know that
it's not because i want it that way.

we are far apart
because i've had to leave you behind.

one day
i hope you're willing
to look for a way out,
and maybe,
just maybe,
to ask me where i've gone.
