i know that i know her
but i cannot tell you about her
because the thought that calls such knowledge
returns with nothing but shame

i know that i must know her
because how could she be fully hidden from me
but i cannot tell you about her
because i have betrayed her
and she cannot trust me now

she needs a hug
i can tell you that
she's scared and alone

i need to know what she wants
because i'm willing to give her just about anything

what does she want?
