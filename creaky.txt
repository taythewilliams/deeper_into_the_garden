The unpolished concrete floor
Is cold on my bare feet

I see a sliver of light 
Coming from underneath the door 
At the top of the basement steps 

light that comes through doesn't illuminate anything 
it's the kind of dark
where you just close your eyes
because no useful light would enter them anyway
