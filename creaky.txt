the unpolished concrete floor
is cold on my bare feet

i see a sliver of light 
coming from underneath the door 
at the top of the basement steps 

light that comes through doesn't illuminate anything 
it's the kind of dark
where your eyes are open as big as your face
but you wonder why they are
because you'd see the same thing if they were closed

the boards creak above
as many feet
walk and waltz and even run
people coming together talking, watching, and sharing

they care nothing for eachother
only how they assume they are perceived

but i'm the freak
hiding in the basement
because this darkness doesn't judge me
and this cold concrete asks nothing of me

i'd rather be alone
i'd rather be afraid of monsters in the dark
than be perceived
