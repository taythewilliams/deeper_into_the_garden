The unpolished concrete floor
Is cold on my bare feet

I see a sliver of light 
Coming from underneath the door 
At the top of the basement steps 

light that comes through doesn't illuminate anything 
it's the kind of dark
where your eyes are open as big as your face
but you wonder why they are
because you'd see the same thing if they were closed
