any notion that you are not alone
is a nice story
a comfy shiny carrot to chase

you are alone
and that can't change

that is your existence 
and it is along side
no other existence 

you are alone
like the wind

you may breeze past fields of flowers
but they don't know you

you may howl with a storm
past a mountain's inhabitants 
but they don't want you

you may come to a halt
and stand very still 
and watch what it is 
that all the little people do without you
---they sit and walk and talk and sing and snarl---
and couldn't notice your absence
even if they tried

you're alone

alone
is you
