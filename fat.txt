it feels like hatred 
like screams
murderous screams

these screams have arms
and those arms have murdery slicing fingertips

they reach to slice off the fat from my sides

i kind of wish they would
but they won't
they are just the will do so
they have no physical power

but they do have power

when i pay attention to them,

they sound like murder
and they feel like hot knives

but when i distract myself from them
...

i'm...

numb?

i'm sad

i'm sad all the time i think

because my body hates me

it doesn't want me
it wants to kick me out
because i've never been there for it
when it needed me most

actually...
it's sad
and it 
needs me

i think it was only ever angry and mean
because its cries were being ignored

i don't know if i really know how to be here for you, body

but i am

i am here for you
will you forgive me?

i love you, body.

thank you for getting my attention

i'm here now.

i love you.
