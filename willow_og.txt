in the center
the most inward part of the garden
there is a willow

wise
too wise to speak to me
but also too wise 
to not help

she is so much older 
than her age

under her branches
hangs a wooden swing
worn smoother than drift wood

her canopy creates a tabernacle
that fills itself with
me

instead of showing me the way
she shows me myself
my true self
and the parts of me
that i'm afraid of
but that i need

her pendant leaves
hanging from trustworthy limbs
smell like peace

they establish safety
and she encourages me
to be
me

without reservation

i'd like to be
for someone else
what she has been for me

thank you willow
