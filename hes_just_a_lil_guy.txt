impatience
having tendency to be quickly irritated or provoked.

sometimes
it picks up my consciousness
and places my focuss
smack in the middle of something new

something i've never known before

i'm swept away from other things
and i don't hold the memory
of who i am
or who i know

because it holds me

it's just a lil guy
but he's strong enough to do it

he's my impatience
he wants to distract me from pain
