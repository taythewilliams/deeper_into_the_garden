i didn't know i was a boy
i was told
here and there

placed on the boy side of the room
when i had no idea
what the division was for

my favorite color was purple
i didn't know that purple was for girls
that boys had to like red
or blue
and anyone could like green
but pink and purple were only for girls
so then i had to pick blue

but i didn't like blue
i didn't know i was a boy

they put some of my classmates
at the front of the recess line
and the other half
always the back
girls in front then
boys in back
and they all seemed to know which half was theirs

i couln't tell the difference
but i was herded to the back half
i didn't know i was a boy

i wanted to be a cheer leader
i didn't know that only girls were allowed
to have pretty hair
and kick their legs high
and have sparkly pom poms
and cheer on their team

i didn't know that girls
were any different than i 
i didn't know i was a boy

i wanted to play with dolls too
i didn't know that only girls were allowed
to play with barbies
and put fun outfits on them 
and make up fun stories for them
so i played with my lego people like dolls

they weren't boys or girls or lego-men
they were just my friends

i didn't know i was a boy
and that there were rules for me
because of this
there was a time when i didn't know
why they were telling me i couldn't
do what some of the other kids were allowed to do

i think i didn't know
because i never was
a boy

i was always just me
a person
maybe a boy and a girl
or maybe something else
but the only reason i ever learned
is because they put me
in that unnecessary box

when i was six
this was confusing
i was troubled by being placed
on one half of a division
that i could hardly distinguish

today
i'm nonbinary
gender-nonconforming
gender-queer

today i believe that boys can like purple
and be cheerleaders
and play with dolls

but beyond that
i refuse put myself in a box
i know that some others
love those boxes
for themselves
but they do not fit me
nor i them

today
i'm nonbinary
because
i was never a boy

they just called me that
and told me what to do
so they didn't have to know me
