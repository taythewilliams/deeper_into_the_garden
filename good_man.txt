"good man"



the spilling of your insecurities 
under miles of neglect
rejuvenates your most familiar facade.

as if determined by gravity,
the survey of your black eyes condescends 
onto good hearts,
knowing them to be retched,
and from your high place
you grant them your holiest of graces
because you are a

good
man.

this human heart of mine
feels the settling of your
malevolent compassion upon me.
this loathsome grace you offer me
has only ever served
to convince the small boy inside you
that you are worthy,
that you indeed never were
the piece of shit that your father
made you see in the mirror.

the air around you is thick.

my soul suffocates
in this room lit up only by your shining
golden crown made of plastic.

you wear it as if you want me to see
that it endows you with divine authority
and you walk with it as if to show me that you humbly bear its burden. 
you want me to know that you alone can bear it
because you are a 

good
man. 

i see a clown in a snorkel mask.
a man with his belly out
holding a child's beach pale
wearing farmer's-tan sun burns. 

i could almost laugh,
but i look over at the small children
that call you daddy
and i cry instead. 
my throat clenched 
unable to breathe
unable to believe
that this is all real
that your delusions of grandeur
are allowed to cause
this. 

i want to save the women
and the children
from the horrors of your dark side
from the deceit-infected bandaids
that you place on their real wounds
as you pretend to know how to help them
---to save them---



but the only one i can save is me
