hey Goose!
you don't need this advice
not from me anyway

i think you may already know it
and if not
you'll learn it on your own
during your life

but this is the most important thing to me
that i've learned so far

love is listening

love isn't
something you just fall into
love isn't
taking someone's responsibilities for them
love isn't
giving perfect advice
and it isn't
the feeling of needing or wanting someone else

love is listening

love is having space for someone
and not just the parts of them that you like

it's true what they say
that you have to learn to love yourself
before you can know
what it's like to love someone else

when you feel an emotion
other parts of you might not like it
but you make space for it
and you listen
and you hold that emotion
until it feels heard

and when you have a lot of emotions
they will often conflict
but you hold space
for each
and listen
to each
and hold them until they've been understood

love is listening

when you listen to them
and hold space for them in your heart
then what scares them won't scare you
what worries them won't worry you
and they begin to trust you
to take care of them

this is how
you love yourself
and this is how
you love someone else

listen
to more than just their words

see and feel
the way you'll learn to see and feel
the parts of you
that share emotion

when you listen
hold space in your heart
for the people that you love
and what scares them won't scare you
what worries them won't worry you
and you'll understand them
the way you understand the parts of you

love is listening

with your heart
