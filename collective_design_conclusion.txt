the issue with
the collective design conclusion
of beauty and body types
and style and life

is not that society
is genuinely out to get us
it's that the cumulative voice
of those that are most easily heard
might be able to appreciate the beauty
of one specific something
but that doesn't mean that we need to 
use it to measure all beauty

the beauty of the mountains is unmatched
and is not the criterion for the beauty of the sea or its shore

all the earth and nature
including me and you 
are beautiful
because we are here and are real
because we are connected to it all
not because we are singular and perfect
but because we are ourselves

so if there is something that you can do
to be the most beautiful
i believe
it is being true to yourself
