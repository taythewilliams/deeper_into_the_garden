you made me believe
that this chain was beautiful
you made me believe
that it protected me

you made me believe
that i was doing the
right
thing

but at some point
i realized that i was holding onto the chains
not the other way around
and walking away from them
wasn't all that scary

it turns out
that the evil you tried to save me from
was nothing compared to the evil
that was you
