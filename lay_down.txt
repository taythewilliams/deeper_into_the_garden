how many days will i lay this
fat body down 
in a bed on the floor

knowing in my fibers
that i am my father

how many days
will i lay this fat body down
to sleep
after giving up on the day
after once again
not reaching the man that i seek

how many days will i lay this fat body down
to sleep

until i wake and find him

i love him and i need him

but i can't find him no matter where i look

i look and i look
some days i don't
because i'm too worn down from the search 
from the journey that i took yesterday
searching for him

some days i search because i love him
and some because
i know he's the only one that can love me

how many days will i lay
this fat body down to sleep
before i don't have to be
this

before i can finally be him?
