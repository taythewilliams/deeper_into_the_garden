I want what I don't have
and I want what I do have

I want everything 
including
the ability 
to want nothing 

I hate everyone
and yet
I always wish 
that I could be loving every one

but
I don't have the time

I do have the time to love me 

but I don't
I just sit here

wanting 

wanting to want nothing 
and
wanting what I don't want to want
