your process
is the passage of time
your process
is to allow your 
unknown mind
to "forget" what it may
your process is blame
and shame
turmoil
and fake joy to balance it out

my process
is confrontation
with poise
and respect

comfortable open eyes
pressed to the abyss
--to the wound

space for feeling
time for understanding
nutrient-rich soil for sitting and for healing

seeing
allowing
accepting
holding
and sometimes letting go
releasing

your process is bitterness
cankering decay in the dark
sweetened with fake sugar

my process is evolution
and life the way mother earth intended
the way she has shown me
