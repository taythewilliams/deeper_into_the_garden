i call them my ghost
sometimes i notice them out of the corner of my eye
sometimes i just know that they're there

sometimes i look over at the place where they stand
sometimes
i believe i might see something even though i know i won't

sometimes i look all around me
because i notice the absence of their presence
and i wonder where they've gone
or what they must be doing instead

he hasn't stopped to tell me who he is
that's not what he's here for
but my ghost
i think i know
who he is

have you ever spent time reflecting on your past?
have you ever imagined a past version of yourself?
have you looked back on them and thought

"i wish you knew
the way that i know
that it will all be ok
that you will be fine"

have you ever looked back at them and thought

"i know this hurts
and i know how lost you feel
but i love you
and you've got this
and the hurt can't last forever"

i have

i have looked back on the versions of my past self
i've stood at the edge of the room
i too afraid to walk up and hold him
so i stand in the corner and cry tears of empathy
knowing that he'll pull through
but wishing that i could do more

my ghost is here now 
as i write this
they know what i'm feeling
better than anyone could
and they know what's coming

i'm afraid
about the future
my ghost doesn't speak
but she comforts me
she's there
and she loves me
and she knows i've got this
and that the hurt can't last forever

it's hard for me to believe that this weight inside my chest
won't last forever
but my ghost
he knows it
because his hair is thinner than mine
and the wrinkles next to his eyes
are just like mine
but just a little deeper

my ghost
i still can't see them when i look
but i know things about them
and they know even more about me
