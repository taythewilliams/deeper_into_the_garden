opponant

you didn't have to be my
you could have just been my mom

you could have just been my friend
you could have just been understanding
you could have just listend

but you chose to fight back
when i was never fighting
you chose to hate my words 
because you have no capacity
for taking ownership over your own actions

you chose to be an opponant
