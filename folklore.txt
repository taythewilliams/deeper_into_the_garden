folklore
is innevitable
the stories
of the good fairies
and of the big bads
they fall through the generations
like water down a stream
like plinko
you don't know how they'll change over time
but they carry
forward and downward

they cannot be stopped because
they cling onto parts of us
they tug at intrinsic fears
and human hopes

i have a dream 
that one day
love will become our folklore
that hate will die
that people will find in themselves
a spark
and they will turn the world's hate
away from themselves
a spark
that will fill them
with love for this earth
and life itself

my dream is that this love
will tug at our fears and hopes
and that it will spread
through generations
can love become our folklore?
