there is one thing for sure,
and that is the fact 
that it is definitely something,

or rather that there is no chance
that it isn't anything at all.

i have whitnessed it--
not in a way that gives me any sense
to guess at it's true nature, but
--at the very least in a way that
convices me
that
it is not
nothing.

it's more than electrons passing a charge
accross a distance,
and it's more that any combination
of variations of such.

there is something that i am
that is under,
or inside of,
or somehow wrapped around
all of the stuff that is described in an anatomy book.

there is something that's inside of the trees--
or there is something that the trees are
which doesn't consist of wood and leaves,
which hides within and around the molecules of such
--and whatever it is
it's the same thing that i am.

there is something that i am
that isn't seen,
but fells like a cat or a bird.
