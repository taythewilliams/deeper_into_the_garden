you pick a color

said the man
behind the counter made of clouds

i have to choose?
just one?
what if i pick wrong 
and wish i picked a different one?
what if someone sees me
and i've picked a different color than them

i look around 
to see 
what color other people have picked
but i can't tell

i pick blue
it seems right

the man hands me blue
but i immediately think
i should have picked green

i'm pretty sure i should have picked green

i walk out and see my family and they ask what color i picked

but it feels like they asked
which co... (muffled sound)

I answer the question
that i think they've asked
but
they are walking away 
they are looking around
they seem lost
but they seem happy about that

i walk through life holding my color

hoping that someday 
someone will ask
hoping that someday
someone will want to see it
