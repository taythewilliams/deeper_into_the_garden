because who can arrogate to themself
the thoughts and feelings of another person?

who can lay claim to the sentiments
of MY soul
or the VIEW
of my mind's eye?

that view is remarkably unknown and beautiful
and possibly the most important view
to ever be apprehended
and inspected
because it IS mine.

i can make no judgement of the contents
of another person's mind
because i can only receive their words
and the occasional glimmer of raw emotion
interpreted by MY OWN brain.

this iota of understanding
is so light
but it's something
and it's very important.

despite it's importance,
i resist and oppose;
something in my body attempts to impede
communication

because

gathering language like packing a snowball
and pushing facial expressions
accross the skin on my cheek bones
and hoping that some amount of meaning
can be guessed at
based on all this
truly feable
exertion

seems to be an experimental feature of my body
and is borderline excruciating.

it hurts because i know that i can't trust it;
it hurts because i know it will betray me.

i earnistly crave the connection of another person
outside
and separate from me,
but how can i know what they mean when they speak,
and how can they know what i see?
how can they know who i am
when language can only carry a lacing
of what i hold?
and no less when my english dictionary
was made so differetly than theirs?

i sit icebound at a precipice;
one that is probably high,
though i have not looked
because i am just barely too frozen.

my exterior is solid,
but my interior is molten
as i wrestle this contravening belief
that speaking words will avail nothing
because i do so desperately want connection,
but i remain suspicious that there is another way.

another way that i have not discovered
to be seen and to see another
without having to excavate terms, speech, and phrases
from my untrustworthy trench of a vocabulary.

if there is such a technique
i hope to find it.

if there is not,
or until i do find it,
i suppose there isn't much else to do
but to try
and try again
and watch my words betray me
and do my best to appologize
and to make up for my failures
and my linguistic inadequacies.

here are some words my friend.
i hope they find you well.
i hope you can provide me
with the best of all the intentions
of which you can conceive
and the benefit of the doubt
as you
respond pretending that you understand me.

here are some words my friend.
i hope that you receive them all
as if they were packaged in something sweet
that smells of whatever you consider
to be real love.

here are some words my friend.
i know that they are not the right ones,
but please know that i have used the time i have
to find these ones,
and i hope that they will do.

here are some words my friend.
i promise that despite what you think they mean
the fact that i share them is something special
at least to me
because it is so very hard to do.
i promise that they truly mean "i love you".
