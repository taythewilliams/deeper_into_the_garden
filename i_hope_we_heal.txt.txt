it's election night
and it's looking like more of the people
that are afraid of abortions and immigrants
went out to vote today
also i took a nap today
so now with that combination
i'm awake at 1:36 am
thinking about
how to get everyone else on this planet
to stop hurting each other

i can't
do it

but my options are to try
or just watch

blissfully fucking unaware didn't work out for me
not that i'm perfectly aware now
but enough
to never stop hurting
deep somewhere in my chest

because why can't we all just love her
and call her by the name that she asks for
even though she used to be steven or bryan or whatever
who the fuck cares what's in her pants goddammit
just have some respect

and why can't we all just figure out
that people aren't worth different amounts
and neither the size
nor shape nor color
of skin
can possibly affect the value of a heart or a mind

why are so few people willing to do the fucking work 
to look inside
and admit
that ignorant people of the past have left some judgment inside us all
and that's not our fault
but it damn well IS our responsibility
to find
and squash
and replace
with something more fair
with just a little bit of willingness to hear people out
with just a little bit of appreciation for people that are different from us

our world has given men a different life
a different view
and a different understanding
than it has given to women
and people of color
and anyone who is different
in some way
than a select type of person

i don't know how we got here
but fuck those lowlifes
that threw out all responsibility
and took what wasn't theirs to take
that stood on the backs of other human beings
and claimed the right to power and money and things
fuck those men that were so dense in the head
who thought their physical strength
meant anything at all about their right to have
what EVERYONE needs and deserves just as much

i don't know how we got here
but whatever happened
it wasn't fair
and i don't believe that there is a single man
who is doing enough
to right what was set wrong

i don't know how we got here
and i don't know what to do
but i just hope
that my existence
however it sprawls along this tiny portion of history
will leave a little more love and life and happiness
for those that wouldn't have had it otherwise

i have no right to believe that i can make a difference
but the damned patriarchy gave that to me anyways
so whether it's true or not
you can bet i'll live the rest of my life trying

a voice in my head says
that everything that anyone has ever done
was with selfish intent
i see how that could be true
but i don't do what i do so that i can feel better about my
shit life or my shit mind
i feel better about my shit self
by learning to love it
and as i do i find this part of me that feels like the real me
and all i have there is this stuff
that feels like light and heat-energy
and the only word i know that might describe what it's made of
is love

that makes me believe that at the center of every human
is something like that
so people might be selfish
a lot
but not always
and in the end i need to help
to be a part of the change
not because it gives me an excuse to hate myself less
but because
as i heal and strip away
whatever hate there is left still inside me
the thing that is left
the thing that is the real me
is something that heals
and holds
and loves
and i think that's what we all are
i think that's our nature

i hope
that whatever that healing force is
in each of us
i hope it wins

i hope it wins in me and in you
and i hope it helps other people do the same
