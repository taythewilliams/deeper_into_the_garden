there are so many layers in my mind
i'm tempted to say too many
but i'm afraid of what i'd be with less
of course
i've always wanted to fit in
to belong
but i've not been able
as of yet to take off some layers
and become simpler than this

it feels like too many because i get lost
i wake up lost
and i often get lost once or twice more before the day ends

finding my way out 
through the layers
is never the same experience
so i don't seem to be improving at that skill

when i'm lost
no one else knows
i'm alone and no one can help me

they say on the internet
that the trick is
to try harder
will power
self control
try harder
will yourself into power
take control of your own mind
try harder
have you no will?
have you no control?

i've tried this for so many years of my life
this mindset
just do it
it's not hard
but the truth is
if it wasn't hard
then i wouldn't find myself so fucking lost
every
day

letting go of control seems to make more sense
will
to me
seems more like finding the love and patience
inside myself to just look around
and notice the layers
and appreciate the ones that i get to see today
they tend to show me themselves
and in that experience
they way out also
