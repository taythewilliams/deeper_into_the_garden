it feels overwhelming
i don't konw
if there will ever be
a way to handle
all of it

and by it
i mean me
all of the parts of me
that i don't always have the time or energy
to listen to

they just bounce around
and
cause chaos

chaos that i live in

that i know so well from the sounds
but not one bit by its truth
