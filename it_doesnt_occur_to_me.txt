it doesn't occur to me
that you like me
or love me
or want me in your life

logically
it is clear that you do

but in my heart
i hold the pain of all the times
where you were hurt by me
and your anger stood up to me for you
and it yelled at me
and i just saw you
yelling

in my heart i hold this pain
and so when you ask me if i want 
to go for a walk with you
i think about whether i want to walk
or if the weather will be pleasant enough
and i think about how far it might be
and i lean towards saying no
because just walking sounds so boring

i think maybe if i didn't hold this pain
then maybe if you asked me to go for a walk
i would put my shoes on without even asking 'where to?'
i think that
maybe your presence might be enough

but in my heart i hold this pain
and i don't hear you asking to spend time with me
i just feel you expecting more of me
more of me than i can give
because it is a chore
to pretend to be 
not what you actually want
but whatever i think i'm supposed to be

in my heart i hold this pain
and so i act
i act like a nice little boy
but i'm actually a scared and tired
and lonely
boy

a lonely boy that doesn't know how to feel love
very well
