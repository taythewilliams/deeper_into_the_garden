this is not a poem
and i am not happy

i am still alive
but he is not
so this is not a poem 
and nothing is ok

this is not a poem
and i do not believe

i am still myself
but part of me is gone
so this is not a poem
and i don't know who i am anymore

this is not a poem
and i hate the people that took him

i still have a future
but i didn't know it would be without him
so this is not a poem
and i hope you don't waste your time reading it

this is not a poem
and i am NOT happy

it's ok to be sad
but how long will i have to be in pain?
this is not a poem
and i don't know how to live

this is not a poem
and nothing in here rhymes

this is how i really feel
but i also feel stupid and guilty for feeling this way
so this is not a poem
because nothing is beautiul anymore and everything sucks
