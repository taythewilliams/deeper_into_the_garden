the river feels like time

she couldn't stop for me
or for anyone
but she knows that i'm here

the river flows with a force
that i can only imagine
nothing can stop her
and nothing really tries

i used to want her to take me
to take me with her
away from my pain

but now i let her go
and i sit here with my pain
because what else is there to do?

now i sit and watch

i feel inspired by her strength
and i'm honored
just to exist
just to watch her flow by
just to imagine her strength
and wonder at her destination

but i don't wonder for too long
because i have pain that i hold
that i need to hear
and sort
and love
and release

and i ask the river to take that pain 
that i have held
and loved
and released
and she takes it
she says nothing
but she takes it
and it desolves
as she flows towards forever

the river feels like time
she knows me
and she lets me sit here on this stone on her bank
to whitness and feel
just a taste
of the power of time
