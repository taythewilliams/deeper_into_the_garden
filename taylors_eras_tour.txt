hi
my name is taylor
and this is a tour of the eras of my life

i don't expect any sold-out shows here
i'm writing this just for you

i'm writing this for you
because it's hard for me to speak

that makes it hard for me to tell you who i am

i think you may already know
but it's better to say something that's been said
than to potentially unexist parts of my past
by leaving them in a place
where i'll eventually wither them away

i had an ignorant era
i mean no era could ever have no ignorance
but there is a clear line
where i went from mostly ignorant
to whatever level of ignorance where i currently reside

i've had eras where all i ever thought of
was running
or building things
or music theory and learning new instruments

those were all during the ignorant era

i met you during that ignorant era
but the day i met you 
i started to change
some changes were not for the better
but i have no regrets

i had an era where the anxiety
that i've always had
began to externally affect my life
and severely limit my capacity

slowly
you pushed me into an era
where i realized that something was wrong with me
and i couldn't keep running away from that

I had an era of hunting for information
an era of finding relief in the discovery of good information
an era of realizing that the information i had found didn't tell the whole story

and then i repeated all those again
when i discovered adhd
and again with autism
and again in smaller forms with the discovery
of many other known symptoms
of growing up with emotionally immature parents

i've had an era of hope
i've always had hope
but this was its strongest pull

i had discovered my inner world and i saw a future
where i would be able to truly know my whole self

i still see that future
but it looks so much further away now
because i've entered the era where i encounter
greater foes within me than i was able to see during that era of hope

those parts of me are concerning always
they terrify me at times
but i also love them at other times

this is the era i'm in
i've made a lot of changes
to who i am
this is the era of accepting the darkest of dark 
that i find in my soul
the era of feeling deeper than i had ever comprehended to be possible
the era of trusting anyway when trust seems too dangerous
the era of truth and reconciliation

i accept this era
i'll walk the walk here

i feel uncomfortable but safe here
like i know i'll be ok
but there's nowhere to sit or rest
i really just have to walk 
and stand 
and lift 
and cry 
and let go 
and allow to let go

i also see an era that is coming
it may have begun
but it's always easier to see that line looking back

it's an era of falling in love again
but for real this time
not falling in love 
because i can't love myself 
and i want someone that's beautiful and real 
to tell me that i'm worth something
and not falling in love
because you're a real-life princess

it's an era of falling in love
because i've learned how to listen
i've always known how to listen to words
but now i know how to listen
to emotion and fear and need
to the push and pull 
of not just the waves of your soul but also the tide

i've learned how to see
and i have the space inside me to feel
and i didn't have that before
so  i loved your face and your smile
and i loved them truly
and i loved your warmth and you felt like home
and i loved the safety that you gave me
and i loved those things truly

but those things are seen even by ignorant eyes
and felt by a boy who just needed a safe place to live

the era that is coming is an era of falling in love
with you
because i can see you now
and i don't need you anymore
and that means
that i can finally want you
and i do
