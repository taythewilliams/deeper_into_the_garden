i look for traps

i don't mean to
it's not what i think i'm looking for

but it IS
what i look for

what i think i want
is safety
i think i'm looking for validation
that i'm good
or worthwhile

or just something other than
the
trash
the
dog shit
on the grass
that no one even bothers to throw away
that disintegrates and degrades
and is forgotten
because if it was ever known
it SHOULD be forgotten

i look for anything that will lie to me
and tell me that i am something
something other than THAT

anything at all

but the problem is
there is nothing that is willing to do this

no person
no situation that i can put myself in

will be capable of allowing me
to run away
from myself

whatever may promise
to tell me i'm good
will not save me

when i go to it
i will be there
waiting for me to come down
from the high of feeling good
for the first time in a while

i'll be there waiting for the come down
so that i can bring myslef even lower
so that i can remind myself who i really am
a piece of shit
that never should have existed

i've tried accepting
that i am bad
i have tried saying that it's ok that i'm bad
that everyone is bad
and no one is only good

but that doesn't lessen the pain
it doesn't stop me from searching
for the traps

i want you to hold me
i want to hear you laugh at my jokes
i want you to tell me it's ok
i want you to tell me that you love me
and that you couldn't live without me
but if you do
it won't help me

i promise
i'll still be there
to hate

and to prove you wrong
i know it's a trap
