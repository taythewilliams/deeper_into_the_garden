fearless
but not.

because to you there was never an inkling 
of fear that needed to be overcome.

you open your eyes in the morning
purely with the energy of discovery.

no request for your opening eyes
to see this world,
or the next,
or whatever there is.

i've never talked with you enough 
to know
what you believe
is on the other side of death.

something
that never scared me before;
something
that causes unsettling aches in me now.

i don't know what you believe you'll see
and i don't know if you're right,

but i'm glad that this is where you are,
that you feel no fear,
that you can enjoy every glance
at faces that you've loved,
that the pain you feel
can't overshadow
the joy
that your life 
has left you with.

goodbye gramcracker.
may the moon
shine on you tonight,
and every night.

i'll remember
the fun that you taught us to have,
the love that you gave us endlessly,
and the peace that you held as you left.
