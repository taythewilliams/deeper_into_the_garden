serenety
the state of calm peacefull
and
the audacity to ignore the fucking truth
right under your fucking nose

peacful ignorance
what a privilege

nothing is ok
nothing is alright

whomp whomp

sorry
no really i do believe
in the concept of real serenety
but that comes from seeing everything 
everything that is inside of you
and accepting and loving it

i have done that before
and i'm trying my best to live there

but all of the things outside of me...
i'm not sure how to love all of that
well at least not all of it

not the stupids.
