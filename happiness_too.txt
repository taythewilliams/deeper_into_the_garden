sometimes
in happy times
i chase the feeling
of creating something
and loving my creation

but that chasing avails nothing
because there is no ache to define
there is no pain to understand
and there is nothing
suffocating inside me
screaming to be heard
demanding that i write

that's a good thing
but it means i have nothing to write
maybe someday
i'll find a way to write about my happiness too
