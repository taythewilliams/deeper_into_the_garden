peace doesn't come from forgetting
because forgetting doesn't exist

peace comes from accepting
from truly seeing
and accepting
every one of the deep
dark places in your mind

it comes from seeing
that they are dark places
because you left them
alone for so long
not because they are scary
or even bad

and it also comes from seeing
that they aren't places at all
they are moments

every moment of your life
and the emotion that filled you
in those moments

that shouldn't be scary

that is not
scary

that is you

and the sum of it all
is so damn beautiful

no peace ever came from forgetting
because
forgetting doesn't exist

forgetting is
just an imaginary concept
invented by shame

invented by weakness
and compelled by shame

fuck shame

you're past has created
the mother-fucking masterpiece that you are
right now

not the masterpiece that you could become

the one that you are right now

do not forget

remember
feel
those places in your mind
that have been darkened
by time and by neglect

shine that light on those again and love them

accept them

that's where peace is

you don't have a choice
about where you can find peace

those that seek it out
by chasing and chasing
all their lives
will never find it

you do have a choice
whether or not you
dig in
to find thee peace

those that
dig
down deep
and love
whatever they may find
will find peace

do not forget
because
forgetting doesn't exist

you do

and your past does

so love that past
love yourself

accept the emotions that you felt
accept the ones that you will feel
and i promise

peace
